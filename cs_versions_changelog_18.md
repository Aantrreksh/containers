## Change log for worker node fix pack 1.8.15_1521, released 20 September 2018
{: #1815_1521}

| Component | Previous | Current | Description |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Log rotate | N/A | N/A | Switched to use `systemd` timers instead of `cronjobs` to prevent `logrotate` from failing on worker nodes that are not reloaded or updated within 90 days. **Note**: In all earlier versions for this minor release, the primary disk fills up after the cron job fails because the logs are not rotated. The cron job fails after the worker node is active for 90 days without being updated or reloaded. If the logs fill up the entire primary disk, the worker node enters a failed state. The worker node can be fixed by using the [`ibmcloud ks worker reload` command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) or the [`ibmcloud ks worker update` command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update). |
| Worker node runtime components (`kubelet`, `kube-proxy`, `docker`) | N/A | N/A | Removed dependencies of runtime components on the primary disk. This enhancement prevents worker nodes from failing when the primary disk is filled up. |
| Root password expiration | N/A | N/A | Root passwords for the worker nodes expire after 90 days for compliance reasons. If your automation tooling needs to log in to the worker node as root or relies on cron jobs that run as root, you can disable the password expiration by logging into the worker node and running `chage -M -1 root`. **Note**: If you have security compliance requirements that prevent running as root or removing password expiration, don't disable the expiration. Instead, you can [update](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update) or [reload](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) your worker nodes at least every 90 days. |
| `systemd` | N/A | N/A | Periodically clean transient mount units to prevent them from becoming unbounded. This action addresses [Kubernetes issue 57345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57345){: external} |

| Kubernetes | v1.8.8 | v1.8.11 | See the [Kubernetes release notes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/releases/tag/v1.8.11]{: external}. This release addresses  [CVE-2017-1002101](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1002101){: external}[ and [CVE-2017-1002102](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2017-1002102){: external}[ vulnerabilities.  \n Now `secret`, `configMap`, `downwardAPI`, and projected volumes are mounted as read-only.
