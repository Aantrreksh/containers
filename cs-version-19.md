| TPM-enabled kernel | N/A | N/A | Bare metal worker nodes with TPM chips for Trusted Compute use the default Ubuntu kernel until trust is enabled. If you [enable trust](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli) on an existing cluster, you need to [reload](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) any existing bare metal worker nodes with TPM chips. To check if a bare metal worker node has a TPM chip, review the **Trustable** field after running the `ibmcloud ks flavors --zone` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_machine_types). |

## Changelog for worker node fix pack 1.9.10_1524, released 20 September 2018
{: #1910_1524}

The following table shows the changes that are in the worker node fix pack 1.9.10_1524.
{: shortdesc}


| Component | Previous | Current | Description |
| -------------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------------- |
| Log rotate | N/A | N/A | Switched to use `systemd` timers instead of `cronjobs` to prevent `logrotate` from failing on worker nodes that are not reloaded or updated within 90 days. **Note**: In all earlier versions for this minor release, the primary disk fills up after the cron job fails because the logs are not rotated. The cron job fails after the worker node is active for 90 days without being updated or reloaded. If the logs fill up the entire primary disk, the worker node enters a failed state. The worker node can be fixed by using the `ibmcloud ks worker reload` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) or the `ibmcloud ks worker update` [command](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update). |
| Worker node runtime components (`kubelet`, `kube-proxy`, `docker`) | N/A | N/A | Removed dependencies of runtime components on the primary disk. This enhancement prevents worker nodes from failing when the primary disk is filled up. |
| Root password expiration | N/A | N/A | Root passwords for the worker nodes expire after 90 days for compliance reasons. If your automation tooling needs to log in to the worker node as root or relies on cron jobs that run as root, you can disable the password expiration by logging into the worker node and running `chage -M -1 root`. **Note**: If you have security compliance requirements that prevent running as root or removing password expiration, don't disable the expiration. Instead, you can [update](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_update) or [reload](/docs/containers?topic=containers-kubernetes-service-cli#cs_worker_reload) your worker nodes at least every 90 days. |
| `systemd` | N/A | N/A | Periodically clean transient mount units to prevent them from becoming unbounded. This action addresses [Kubernetes issue 57345](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/57345){: external} |
| Docker | N/A | N/A | Disabled the default Docker bridge so that the `172.17.0.0/16` IP range is now used for private routes. If you rely on building Docker containers in worker nodes by executing `docker` commands on the host directly or by using a pod that mounts the Docker socket, choose from the following options. \n - To ensure external network connectivity when you build the container, run `docker build . --network host`. \n - To explicitly create a network to use when you build the container, run `docker network create` and then use this network. \n **Note**: Have dependencies on the Docker socket or Docker directly? Update to `containerd` instead of `docker` as the container runtime so that your clusters are prepared to run Kubernetes version 1.11 or later. |

| {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider | v1.9.9-167 | v1.9.10-192 | Updated to support Kubernetes 1.9.10 release. In addition, changed the cloud provider configuration to better handle updates for load balancer services with `externalTrafficPolicy` set to `local`. |
| {{site.data.keyword.filestorage_full_notm}} plug-in | 334 | 338 | Updated incubator version to 1.8. File storage is provisioned to the specific zone that you select. You can't update an existing (static) PV instance's labels, unless you are using a multizone cluster and need to add the region and zone labels.  \n Removed the default NFS version from the mount options in the IBM-provided file storage classes. The host's operating system now negotiates the NFS version with the IBM Cloud infrastructure NFS server. To manually set a specific NFS version, or to change the NFS version of your PV that was negotiated by the host's operating system, see [Changing the default NFS version](/docs/containers?topic=containers-file_storage#nfs_version_class). |
