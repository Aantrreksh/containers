# Observing Kubernetes Ingress
{: #cs_ingress_monitor}

You can monitor the Kubernetes Ingress ALBs by using {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}. 
{: shortdesc}


## Setting up monitoring with {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}
{: #ingress_health_mon}

Gain operational visibility into the performance and health of your Kubernetes Ingress ALBs by deploying a {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} agent to your worker nodes to forward metrics to {{site.data.keyword.mon_full}}. When you deploy a monitoring agent to the worker nodes in your cluster, Monitoring is already automatically enabled to detect and scrape the data  and then display them in your {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}} dashboard.
{: shortdesc}

1. [Provision an instance of {{site.data.keyword.mon_full_notm}}](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring/create){: external}.

2. Configure a monitoring agent in your cluster.

    1. Select your monitor from the [Monitoring](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring){: external} page.
    2. Click **Monitoring sources**.
    3. Follow the instructions for installing a monitoring agent to your cluster.
    
    Note that it may take a few minutes for your agent to finish installing.

3. In the [Monitoring console](https://cloud.ibm.com/observe/monitoring){: external}, click **Open Dashboard** for the instance that you provisioned.

4. In the {{site.data.keyword.mon_short}} UI, click **Dashboards** > **Applications** > **NGINX Ingress**. Note that the **NGINX Ingress** dashboard does not appear until there is data available. This process can take some time.

    The **NGINX Ingress** dashboard is visible only when the monitoring agent finds `nginx_ingress_controller_requests metrics`. These metrics are exposed when you send queries to the hosts that are defined in your Ingress resources.
