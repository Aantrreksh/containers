# Service limitations
{: #limitations}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong}} and the Kubernetes open source project come with default service settings and limitations to ensure security, convenience, and basic functionality. Some of the limitations you might be able to change where noted.
{: shortdesc}
<br>

If you anticipate reaching any of the following {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} limitations, [contact IBM Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar) and provide the cluster ID, the new quota limit, the region, and infrastructure provider in your support ticket.
{: tip}

## Service and quota limitations
{: #tech_limits}

{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} comes with the following service limitations and quotas that apply to all clusters, independent of what infrastructure provider you plan to use. Keep in mind that the [classic](#classic_limits) and [VPC](#ks_vpc_gen2_limits) cluster limitations also apply.
{: shortdesc}

To view quota limits on cluster-related resources in your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, use the `ibmcloud ks quota ls` command.
{: tip}

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| API rate limits | 200 requests per 10 seconds to the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} API from each unique source IP address. |
| App deployment | The apps that you deploy to and services that you integrate with your cluster must be able to run on the operating system of the worker nodes. |
| Cluster quota | You cannot exceed 100 clusters per region and per [infrastructure provider](/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers). If you need more of the resource, [contact IBM Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar). In the support case, include the new quota limit for the region and infrastructure provider that you want.|
| Kubernetes | Make sure to review the [Kubernetes project limitations](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/best-practices/cluster-large/){: external}. |
| KMS provider | Customizing the IP addresses that are allowed to connect to your {{site.data.keyword.keymanagementservicefull}} instance is not supported. |
| Kubernetes pod logs | To check the logs for individual app pods, you can use the command line to run `kubectl logs <pod name>`. Do not use the Kubernetes dashboard to stream logs for your pods, which might cause a disruption in your access to the Kubernetes dashboard. |
| Load balancers | **Kubernetes 1.20 or later**: Although the Kubernetes [SCTP protocol](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#sctp){: external} and [application protocol](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#application-protocol){: external} features are generally available in the community release, creating load balancers that use these protocols is not supported in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} clusters.|
| Pod instances | You can run 110 pods per worker node. If you have worker nodes with 11 CPU cores or more, you can support 10 pods per core, up to a limit of 250 pods per worker node. The number of pods includes `kube-system` and `ibm-system` pods that run on the worker node. For improved performance, consider limiting the number of pods that you run per compute core so that you do not overuse the worker node. For example, on a worker node with a `b3c.4x16` flavor, you might run 10 pods per core that use no more than 75% of the worker node total capacity. |
| Worker node quota | You cannot exceed 500 worker nodes across all clusters in a region, per [infrastructure provider](/docs/containers?topic=containers-infrastructure_providers). If you need more of the resource, [contact IBM Support](/docs/get-support?topic=get-support-using-avatar). In the support case, include the new quota limit for the region and infrastructure provider that you want.|
| Worker pool size | You must have a minimum of 1 worker node in your cluster and each worker pool at all times. For more information, see [What is the smallest size cluster that I can make?](/docs/containers?topic=containers-faqs#smallest_cluster). You cannot scale worker pools down to zero. Because of the worker node quota, you are limited in the number of worker pools per cluster and number of worker nodes per worker pool. For example, with the default worker node quota of 500 per region, you might have up to 500 worker pools of 1 worker node each in a region with only 1 cluster. Or, you might have 1 worker pool with up to 500 worker nodes in a region with only 1 cluster. |

## VPC Gen 2 compute cluster limitations
{: #ks_vpc_gen2_limits}

<img src="images/icon-vpc.png" alt="VPC infrastructure provider icon" width="15" style="width:15px; border-style: none"/> VPC Generation 2 compute clusters in {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} are released with the following limitations. Additionally, all the underlying [VPC quotas, VPC limits](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-quotas), [VPC service limitations](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-limitations), and [regular service limitations](#tech_limits) apply.
{: shortdesc}

### Compute
{: #vpc_gen2_compute_limit}

Keep in mind that the [service](#tech_limits) limitations also apply.

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| Encryption | The secondary disks of your worker nodes are encrypted at rest by default by the [underlying VPC infrastructure provider](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-block-storage-about#vpc-storage-encryption). However, you cannot [bring your own encryption to the underlying virtual server instances](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-creating-instances-byok).|
| Location | VPC Gen 2 clusters are available only in [select multizone metro locations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-regions-and-zones#zones-vpc). |
| Operating system | You cannot create a cluster with worker nodes that run multiple operating systems, such as {{site.data.keyword.openshiftshort}} on Red Hat Enterprise Linux and community Kubernetes on Ubuntu. |
| Versions | VPC Gen 2 clusters must run Kubernetes version 1.17 or later. |
| Virtual Private Cloud | See [Known limitations](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-known-limitations) and [Quotas](/docs/vpc-on-classic?topic=vpc-on-classic-quotas). |
| v2 API | VPC clusters use the [{{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} v2 API](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cs_api_install#api_about). The v2 API is currently under development, with only a limited number of API operations currently available. You can run certain v1 API operations against the VPC cluster, such as `GET /v1/clusters` or `ibmcloud ks cluster ls`, but not all the information that a Classic cluster has is returned or you might experience unexpected results. For supported VPC v2 operations, see the [CLI reference topic for VPC commands](/docs/containers?topic=containers-cli-plugin-kubernetes-service-cli). |
| Worker node flavors | Only certain flavors are available for worker node [virtual machines](/docs/containers?topic=containers-planning_worker_nodes#vm). Bare metal machines are not supported.|
| Worker node host access | For security, you cannot SSH into the worker node compute host. |
| Worker node updates | You cannot update or reload worker nodes. Instead, you can delete the worker node and rebalance the worker pool with the `ibmcloud ks worker replace` command. If you replace multiple worker nodes at the same time, they are deleted and replaced concurrently, not one by one. Make sure that you have enough capacity in your cluster to reschedule your workloads before you replace worker nodes. |

{: caption="VPC Gen 2 cluster compute limitations"}


### Networking
{: #vpc_gen2_networking_limit}

Keep in mind that the [service](#tech_limits) limitations also apply.

| Category | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| App URL length | Kubernetes version 1.20 or later only: DNS resolution is managed by the cluster's [virtual private endpoint (VPE)](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_vpe), which can resolve URLs up to 130 characters. If you expose apps in your cluster with URLs, such as the Ingress subdomain, ensure that the URLs are 130 characters or fewer. |
| Istio managed add-on | See [Istio add-on limitations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-istio-about#istio_limitations). |
| Network speeds | [VPC Gen 2 compute profile network speeds](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-profiles) refer to the speeds of the worker node interfaces. The maximum speed available to your worker nodes is `16Gbps`. Because IP in IP encapsulation is required for traffic between pods that are on different VPC Gen 2 worker nodes, data transfer speeds between pods on different worker nodes might be slower, about half the compute profile network speed. Overall network speeds for apps that you deploy to your cluster depend on the worker node size and application's architecture. |
| NodePort | You can access an app through a NodePort only if you are connected to your private VPC network, such as through a VPN connection. To access an app from the internet, you must use a VPC load balancer or Ingress service instead. |
| Pod network | VPC access control lists (ACLs) filter incoming and outgoing traffic for your cluster at the subnet level, and security groups filter incoming and outgoing traffic for your cluster at the worker nodes level. To control traffic within the cluster at the pod-to-pod level, you cannot use VPC security groups or ACLs. Instead, use [Calico](/docs/containers?topic=containers-network_policies) and [Kubernetes network policies](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy#kubernetes_policies), which can control the pod-level network traffic that uses IP in IP encapsulation. |
| strongSwan VPN service | The strongSwan service is not supported. To connect your cluster to resources in an on-premises network or another VPC, see [Using VPN with your VPC](/docs/vpc?topic=vpc-vpn-onprem-example). |
| Subnets | <ul><li>See [VPC networking limitations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-subnets#vpc_basics_limitations).</li><li>Do not delete the subnets that you attach to your cluster during cluster creation or when you add worker nodes in a zone. If you delete a VPC subnet that your cluster used, any load balancers that use IP addresses from the subnet might experience issues, and you might be unable to create new load balancers.</li></ul> |
| VPC load balancer | See [VPC load balancer limitations](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-lbaas#lbaas_limitations). |
| VPC security groups | VPC Gen 2 clusters that run Kubernetes version 1.18 or earlier only: You must [allow inbound traffic requests to node ports on your worker nodes](/docs/containers?topic=containers-vpc-network-policy#security_groups). |
